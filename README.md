# Machine Learning Projects

Jupyter and Colab Notebooks for completed projects

### Dog_Vision.ipynb : Trained a Multiclass Classification machine learning model on a dataset of 10,000+ files containing images of 120 classes(dog breeds). Used Tensor Flow to convert images into the required shape for the MobileNet v2 model from TensorFlow Hub.

### Stock_Market_analysis : Performed comparative analysis on the dataset containing details about the price of a stock market over a year. Increased the accuracy by 20% after performing data preprocessing, data transformation, hyperparameter tuning and cross validation.
